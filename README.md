# Javascript-PP2
<h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors<h1>


<h2><b>Minimum Viable Product-Logic</b></h2>
Due to timeline for submissions and my working full-time during the week, I decided to focus on completing one of the outlined tasks to the highest possible quality level as opposed to overcomplicating an original design that I would not have time to execute properly. I planned on completing the Javascript modules in a comprehensive fashion, giving myself time to absorb the logic and to develop a proper understanding prior to starting the project. Accordingly, I took my time going through the videos.
  I decided on the 'Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock' project as I was familiar with the game and appreciated the demo video provided by CI.
I planned on having shorter simpler HTML and CSS pages so that I could truly focus on ensuring the Javascript code was adequate.


<h1>Design</h1>

<b>Explanation of the purpose of the game:</b> An interactive game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors,Lizard, Spock' that enables users to play the well-known game against the computer without being able to easily predict an outcome. The game is the best of three and then resets. 
<b>Value that the game provides to its users:</b> An entertaining and engaging game that is sponstaneous in it's selection. It is an impartial competitor for the user to play against in the game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock', as it is the user versus computer essentially.
<b>Description of the deployment procedure:</b> As usual, I created my project on the GITHUB platform, as supported by CI. Once the project was fully complete, fully tested and formatted properly, I followed the usual steps to deploy the project. Please see the description of the steps as well as screenshots below:


<b>Balsamiq wireframes</b>

To give myself an overall idea of the project prior to inputting code, I completed a rough design on Balsamiq Wireframes, screengrab inserted below. 
I allowed a page for HTML, CSS and Javascript and broke each into sections so that I would not forget an integral aspect of any of the pages or forget to include an important link. I separate page listinge the Javascript functions that i used in building the project, with a brief explanation of each provided.

<b>Learning from Project 1: Responsiveness</b>

My weakest area in PP1 HTML&CSS was the responsiveness. I had tried to use flex-box and relative percentages but did not do this adequately as there were issues across various devices in the responsiveness. I decided to be very thorough with my media-queries and responsiveness testing on this project as a result. I reviewed the tutorials and scoured slack to assist me with this.

<b>Testing:</b>
As I was building my Javascript Code in particular, I constantly had a browser open and was inspecting the consold via developer tools and was amending errors as they occurred. I found this to be a very efficient way of refining the project as the developer tools points to the exact line of the error and offers a brief explanation.
Mobile first design-testing the website for responsiveness on a number of different devices via developer tools. As per the grid below, I used developer tools to view the finished project on a number of different viewport and please see below how they reacted to respsonsiveness.
Lighthouse: All high, passable. Particularly accessiblilty
W3C HTML:
Ran HTML Code through the W3C validator and, as per below screengrab, no errors were found.
Screengrab:

W3C CSS:
Ran CSS Code through the W3C validator and, as per below screengrab, no errors were found.
Screegrab:

JSHint (new testing method included in this module-specific to Javascript)
I ran the Javascript Code through JSHint and discovered the following errors and warnings. Please see how I resolved/responded to the errors in each case below:

<b>Manual testing & Responsiveness</b>

Developer Tools as well as manually checking on my real mobile and different laptops.

What different viewports/devices were tested and what was observed

<b>Design:</b>

<em>Color scheme</em>: Fast-paced game and would require intense staring at the screen. Did not want something too bright or strong as that may have caused eye soreness or the glare from the screen may have negated from the game. Went for '', a strong colour but also easy on the eye that would compliment the intensive staring required of the game.
<em>Font:</em> I did thorough research on Google Fonts before I decided on the 'Bungee Spice' font. I wanted something fun, inkeeping with the theme of the game but also legible and clear.
<em> Favicons:</em> I inserted the favicon link in the head of the HTML page to enable functionality. This is a fun new feature to this.
<em>Animation</em> I enabeled Animate CSS via HTML and inserted an eye catching animation on the title. This created the fun, games vibe that I desired.
<em>Interactivity:</em> The five buttons present the user with the option to select. The computer simultaenously responds with their answer. The answers are compared and the game decides on the winner, considering the rules of the game. The score is incremented accordingly. Also the text-area updates to disclose who has won the round. The game is best of three so the overall winner is decided by who wins three rounds. Then the game resets.
<em>Accessibility:</em> I ensured to include ALTs and aria-labels where possible to assist screen readers. Not reliant on audio queues to be accessible to deaf users. Nothing automatically plays without the user initiating it.

<h2>Overview of the Project</h2>

<em>'Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock'</em>
 <em>What the project hopes to accomplish:</em> 'Rock, Paper,Scissors, Lizard, Spock' is an interactive, fast-paced online version of the age-old classic, 'Rock, Paper, Scissors', without the need for any props or other players. It is simple to understand and easily accessible. All you need to play is yourself and your laptop.
 <em>Who it is intended to target:</em> Ages 14+. Anybody in a waiting room of any sort or on a long train/bus journey or just on a cheeky lunch break from school or work. Only one player required and no actual rocks, paper, scissors, lizard or spock needed at all.
 <em>How it will be useful to the target audience: It is an engaging and interactive game that people can play on their own. It is useful as it does not require mrore than one person and provides spontaneous, interactive fun that is easy to understand.It does not required a large amount of concentration at a time and it resets automatically.</em>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.</p>

<h3>Existing Features-page by page</h3>

<h3>Features left to implement</h3>
-As opposed to just text being prompted on each game, a little gif or video could play depending on whether the user has
lost or won the game. (E.g. a gif of somebody falling if the loser has lost the game)
-Timer appears: To introduce an element of urgency, I would insert a countdown timer that allows the user 15 seconds to choose their button on each round or else the game resets.
-Loaders

<b>Testing</b>
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

<b>Credits</b>
-I was greatly inspired by the tutorials provided on this module, in particular the 'Love Maths' walkthrough project and the PP2 scoping video which incpired my project.
-In building the repositary, I completed the walk-through project 'Love Math' whilst listening to the tutorials. I used that code as boilerplate code and then edited that code to redesign it to my Javascript project.

I found that this enabled me to have confidence in the structure.

I decided to go with 'Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock' as I am familiar with the traditional game and per the PP2 video provided by CI, I saw definite areas of connection between the design format of this game and the 'Love Math' wlakthrough game tha they supplied (e.g. game area, score area)

I was panicking initially when thnking of how to design my Javascript functions and what order to have them etc and drew great inspiration from the slack channel. I reviewed a number of different query threads from different students on the PP2 section and this inspired a lot of my code.
