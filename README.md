# Javascript-PP2

<h2><b>Minimum Viable Product-Logic</b></h2>
Due to time constraints, I decided to focus on completing one of the outlined tasks to the highest possible quality level
as opposed to overcomplicating an original design that I would not have time to execute properly. I planned on completing the Javascript modules in a comprehensive fashion, giving myself time to absorb the logic and to develop a proper understanding prior to starting the project. Accordingly, I took my time going through the videos and fell behind with KPIs.
I decided on the rock, paper scissors project as I was familiar with the game and appreciated the demo video provided by CI.
I planned on having shorter simpler HTML and CSS pages so that I could truly focus on ensuring the Javascript code was adequate.


<h1>Design</h1>
(Per Learning Outcomes)
Explanation of the purpose of the game: An interactive game of rock, paper, scissors that enables users to play the well-known game without being able to easily predict an outcome.
Value that the game provides to its users: An entertaining and engaging game that is sponstaneous in it's selection. It is an impartial competitor for the user to play against in the game of rock paper, scissors as it is user versus computer essentially.
Description of the deployment procedure: As usual, I created my project on the GITHUB platform, as supported by CI. Once the project was fully complete, fully tested and formatted properly, I followed the usual steps to deploy the project. Please see the description of the steps as well as screenshots below:

<h2>Deployment</h2>
GITHUB: 
Enter GITHUB Pages
Set to Main
Make live
Launch
Wait
Check url

4.2	Insert screenshots of the project features, give a brief description of what each feature does and explain its value to the user.
4.3	Attribute all code from external sources to its original source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
4.4	Clearly separate and identify code written for the website and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials)
4.5	Organise HTML, CSS and JavaScript code into well-defined and commented sections
