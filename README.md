# Javascript-PP2
<h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors<h1>


<h2><b>Minimum Viable Product-Logic</b></h2>
Due to time constraints, I decided to focus on completing one of the outlined tasks to the highest possible quality level
as opposed to overcomplicating an original design that I would not have time to execute properly. I planned on completing the Javascript modules in a comprehensive fashion, giving myself time to absorb the logic and to develop a proper understanding prior to starting the project. Accordingly, I took my time going through the videos.
  I decided on the 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' project as I was familiar with the game and appreciated the demo video provided by CI.
I planned on having shorter simpler HTML and CSS pages so that I could truly focus on ensuring the Javascript code was adequate.


<h1>Design</h1>

<b>Explanation of the purpose of the game:</b> An interactive game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' that enables users to play the well-known game without being able to easily predict an outcome.
<b>Value that the game provides to its users:</b> An entertaining and engaging game that is sponstaneous in it's selection. It is an impartial competitor for the user to play against in the game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissor', as it is user versus computer essentially.
<b>Description of the deployment procedure:</b> As usual, I created my project on the GITHUB platform, as supported by CI. Once the project was fully complete, fully tested and formatted properly, I followed the usual steps to deploy the project. Please see the description of the steps as well as screenshots below:

<b>Balsamiq wireframes</b>

To give myself an overall idea of the project prior to inputting code, I completed a rough design on Balsamiq Wireframes. 
I allowed a page for HTML, CSS and Javascript and broke each into sections so that I would not forget an integral aspect of any of the pages or forget to include an important link. I also had a list on a separate page of the Javascript functions used in totality throughout the project.

<b>Learning from Project 1: Responsiveness</b>

My weakest area in PP1 HTML&CSS was the responsiveness. I had tried to use flex-box and relative percentages but did not do this adequately as there were issues across various devices in the responsiveness. I decided to be very thorough with my media-queries and responsiveness testing on this project as a result.

<b>Testing:</b>
Mobile first design-testing the website for responsiveness on a number of different devices via developer tools.
Lighthouse
W3C HTML
W3C CSS
JSHint (new testing method included in this module)

<b>Manual testing & Responsiveness</b>

Developer Tools as well as manually checking on my real mobile and different laptops.

What different viewports/devices were tested and what was observed

<b>Design:</b>

<em>Color scheme</em>: Fast-paced game and would require intense staring at the screen. Did not want something too bright or strong as that may have caused eye soreness or the glare from the screen may have negated from the game. Went for '', a strong colour but also easy on the eye that would compliment the intensive staring required of the game.
<em>Font:</em> I did thorough research on Google Fonts before I decided on the '' font. I wanted something fun, inkeeping with the theme of the game but also legible and clear.
<em>Interactivity:</em> Javascript...functions...clicks...
<em>Accessibility:</em> I ensured to include ALTs and aria-labels where possible to assist screen reads. Not reliant on audio queues to be accessible to deaf users.

<h2>Overview of the Project</h2>

<em>'Rock, Paper, Scissors without partners or props'</em>
 <em>What the project hopes to accomplish:</em> 'Rock, Paper,Scissors without partners or props' is an interactive, fast-paced online version of the age-old classic, 'Rock, Paper, Scissors', without the need for any props or other players. It is simple to understand and easily accessible. All you need to play is yourself and your laptop.
 <em>Who it is intended to target:</em> Ages 14+. Anybody in a waiting room of any sort or on a long train/bus journey or just on a cheeky lunch break from school or work. Only one player required and no actual rocks, scissors or paper needed at all.
 <em>How it will be useful to the target audience: It is an engaging and interactive game that people can play on their own. It is useful as it does not require mrore than one person and provides spontaneous, interactive fun that is easy to understand.</em>
