# Javascript-PP2
<h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors<h1>


<h2><b>Minimum Viable Product-Logic</b></h2>
Due to time constraints, I decided to focus on completing one of the outlined tasks to the highest possible quality level
as opposed to overcomplicating an original design that I would not have time to execute properly. I planned on completing the Javascript modules in a comprehensive fashion, giving myself time to absorb the logic and to develop a proper understanding prior to starting the project. Accordingly, I took my time going through the videos.
  I decided on the 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' project as I was familiar with the game and appreciated the demo video provided by CI.
I planned on having shorter simpler HTML and CSS pages so that I could truly focus on ensuring the Javascript code was adequate.


<h1>Design</h1>

<b>Explanation of the purpose of the game:</b> An interactive game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' that enables users to play the well-known game without being able to easily predict an outcome.
<b>Value that the game provides to its users:</b> An entertaining and engaging game that is sponstaneous in it's selection. It is an impartial competitor for the user to play against in the game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissor', as it is user versus computer essentially.
<b>Description of the deployment procedure:</b> As usual, I created my project on the GITHUB platform, as supported by CI. Once the project was fully complete, fully tested and formatted properly, I followed the usual steps to deploy the project. Please see the description of the steps as well as screenshots below:


<b>Balsamiq wireframes</b>

To give myself an overall idea of the project prior to inputting code, I completed a rough design on Balsamiq Wireframes. 
I allowed a page for HTML, CSS and Javascript and broke each into sections so that I would not forget an integral aspect of any of the pages or forget to include an important link. I also had a list on a separate page of the Javascript functions used in totality throughout the project.

<b>Learning from Project 1: Responsiveness</b>

My weakest area in PP1 HTML&CSS was the responsiveness. I had tried to use flex-box and relative percentages but did not do this adequately as there were issues across various devices in the responsiveness. I decided to be very thorough with my media-queries and responsiveness testing on this project as a result.

<b>Testing:</b>
Mobile first design-testing the website for responsiveness on a number of different devices via developer tools.
Lighthouse
W3C HTML
W3C CSS
JSHint (new testing method included in this module)

<b>Manual testing & Responsiveness</b>

Developer Tools as well as manually checking on my real mobile and different laptops.

What different viewports/devices were tested and what was observed

<b>Design:</b>

<em>Color scheme</em>: Fast-paced game and would require intense staring at the screen. Did not want something too bright or strong as that may have caused eye soreness or the glare from the screen may have negated from the game. Went for '', a strong colour but also easy on the eye that would compliment the intensive staring required of the game.
<em>Font:</em> I did thorough research on Google Fonts before I decided on the '' font. I wanted something fun, inkeeping with the theme of the game but also legible and clear.
<em>Interactivity:</em> Javascript...functions...clicks...
<em>Accessibility:</em> I ensured to include ALTs and aria-labels where possible to assist screen reads. Not reliant on audio queues to be accessible to deaf users.

<h2>User Experience- The Five Planes</h2>
Scope
Structure


<h2>Overview of the Project</h2>

<em>'Rock, Paper, Scissors without partners or props'</em>
 <em>What the project hopes to accomplish:</em> 'Rock, Paper,Scissors without partners or props' is an interactive, fast-paced online version of the age-old classic, 'Rock, Paper, Scissors', without the need for any props or other players. It is simple to understand and easily accessible. All you need to play is yourself and your laptop.
 <em>Who it is intended to target:</em> Ages 14+. Anybody in a waiting room of any sort or on a long train/bus journey or just on a cheeky lunch break from school or work. Only one player required and no actual rocks, scissors or paper needed at all.
 <em>How it will be useful to the target audience: It is an engaging and interactive game that people can play on their own. It is useful as it does not require mrore than one person and provides spontaneous, interactive fun that is easy to understand.</em>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.</p>

<h3>Existing Features</h3>
HTML:
Created the usual HTML page, titled 'Index.html'
Inserted the necessary links to connect it with the CSS and Javascript pages
Link for CSS: '<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/style.css">'  Location: Contained within the <head> on the HTML page
Link for Javascript: 'assets/js/script.js'  Location: Contained within the <body> on the HTML page
CSS: The focus here was having simple, legible design that was also fun in color scheme and responsive. Clearly divided the different sections using comments.
Javascript: The focus of this project. Interactive, spontaneous, well-thought through.
Font Awesome: I knew I wanted to add some of these fun icons
Link: Location
Favicon:
I knew I wanted to add a fun favicon.
Link: Location:
Animations:
In keeping with the fun, interactive theme, I wanted to add a bit of pizzazz to the page with an animation:
Link:   Location:  What is it?:
Loaders: As there is an element of suspense to this game...3,2,1 countdown, loader to help player prerpare
Link:  Location:

<h3>Features left to implement</h3>
-Audio that the user can select to play
-Pacing
-Timer appears
-Different gifs/short videos appear prompted by whether the player/computer has lost and also based on the score. For example, the more the player is losing by, the more dramatic and catastrophic the video will be in response to losing another point.

<b>Testing</b>
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Developers Tools (viewport testing): In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

<em>Validator Testing</em>
<b>HTML</b>
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
<b>CSS</b>
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
<b>Javascript</b>
JSHint

<b>Unfixed Bugs</b>
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. 

<b>Deployment</b>
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
I logged into GITHUB (Subscription hours provided by CI)
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, I selected the 'Master Branch'
The page then automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

<b>Credits</b>
I was greatly inspired by the tutorials provided on this module.
In building the repositary, I completed the walk-through project 'Love Math' whilst listening to the tutorials. I did this on the PP2 Repositary and once complete, edited that code to redesign it to my Javascript project.

I found that this enabled me to have confidence in the structure.

I decided to go with RPS as I am familiar with the traditional game and per the PP2 video provided by CI, I saw definite areas of connection between the design format of this game and the Love Math game they supplied (e.g. game area, score area)
